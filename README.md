# ActionMapper2 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lcobucci/action-mapper.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/lcobucci/action-mapper)

ActionMapper 2 is an open source front-controller micro-framework for PHP 5.3+. [More information](http://lcobucci.github.com/action-mapper).

## Installation

You can download or clone the repository from git (just the src/* contents are relevant), or install it from PEAR (recomended, because it will install all the dependencies automatically).

To install using PEAR you just have to type this on your console (as root if needed):

```
$ pear config-set auto_discover 1
$ pear install lcobucci.github.com/ActionMapper2
```
